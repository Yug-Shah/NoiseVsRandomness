# Noise versus Randomness
YQuantum 2024 -- DoraHacks Challenge

Take the output from a quantum random number generator as training data, the data is produced by different IBMQ simulators (including noise). Find a way to create a model that classifies new random number output, and identifies which machine the random number is produced from. The quantum random number generator functions as described in https://github.com/dorahacksglobal/quantum-randomness-generator. Run experiments by yourself, and compare different models. Is this classification task possible? What are the possible ways to improve the model so that it's useful?
