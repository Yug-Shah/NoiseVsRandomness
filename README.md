# Noise versus Randomness
YQuantum 2024 -- DoraHacks Challenge

Utilized the output from a quantum random number generator as training data - "AI_2qubits_training_data.txt", data produced by different IBMQ simulators (including noise). Explored the possibility of creating a model that classifies new random number output, and identifies which machine produced the random number. The quantum random number generator functions as described in https://github.com/dorahacksglobal/quantum-randomness-generator. We compared different machine learning models and ran several tests to understand whether this classification task is possible.
